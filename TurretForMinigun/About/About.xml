	<description>This mod changes the default minigun to be a turret-mounted weapon instead of a hand-held weapon. This makes it a little closer to the real-world version. This also fills an empty niche in the base game, namely a manned direct-fire turret. As a trade-off for the loss of mobility, and for the new power requirement, its rate of fire and burst are increased.</description>
