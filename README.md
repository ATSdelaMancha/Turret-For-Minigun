# Turret-For-Minigun

This mod changes the default minigun to be a turret-mounted weapon instead of a hand-held weapon. This makes it a little closer to the real-world version. This also fills an empty niche in the base game, namely a manned direct-fire turret. As a trade-off for the loss of mobility, and for the new power requirement, its rate of fire and burst are increased.

**Compatibility with current save:** I haven't done enough testing to make promises, but I think it should work. Existing miniguns will probably still work as hand-held weapons until pawns drop them, at which point they will mysteriously vanish, probably.

**Compatibility with other mods:** I have done no testing of this at all. I haven't made it compatible with CE, but I hope to do so at some point. Again, no promises.
